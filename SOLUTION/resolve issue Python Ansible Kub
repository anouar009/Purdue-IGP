Steps to Resolve:
Deactivate the Virtual Environment:

First, deactivate the virtual environment:


deactivate
This command will reset your environment to use the system-wide Python and pip installations.

Check the System-Wide Python and Pip:

After deactivating the virtual environment, verify that python3 and pip3 point to the system-wide versions:


which python3
which pip3
The output should now point to /usr/bin/python3 and /usr/bin/pip3, respectively.

Reinstall the Kubernetes Package Globally:

Now, install the kubernetes package globally using the system-wide pip3:


sudo pip3 install kubernetes
Verify the Installation:

Check if Python can now successfully import the kubernetes module:


python3 -c "import kubernetes"
If Problems Persist:
If python3 and pip3 continue to point to the virtual environment after running deactivate, you might need to remove the virtual environment or adjust your shellâ€™s configuration files (e.g., .bashrc or .bash_profile) to stop automatically activating the virtual environment.

Removing the Virtual Environment (Optional):
If you no longer need the virtual environment and want to remove it:


rm -rf /home/anouar/Purdue-IGP/.venv
This command will delete the virtual environment, ensuring that your shell uses the system-wide Python by default.
